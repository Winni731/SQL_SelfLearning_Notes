An Algebra is:
- Operands (Values): variables, constants, closed domain
- Operators: +, *
- Expressions: Combine operations with parenthesis or using either preceduence
- Laws: Identify semantically equivalent expressions, Commutativity, associativity

Relational Algebra:
- values: Finite relations (cardinality and arity both bounded); Attributes may or may not be typed
- Operators: Unary, "Additive" (set), "Multiplicative", []
- Expressions: same as arithmetic, but called "queries"
- Laws: allow "query rewriting", basis for query optimization, []

SigmaP(R) outputs tuples of R which satisfy P same schema as R

Unary Operators:
- select (Sigma)
- project(Pi)
- rename(Ro)

Additive Operators: Union, Intersection, Difference
- standard set operators
- Operate on tuples within input relations, but not on schema

Cartesian Product (x)
- the outcome of combining every record in R with every record in S
- T = R x S contains every pairwise combination of R and S tuples
- |T| = |R|*|S|

Division (/)
- Let R and S be relations with schemas A1, A2, ..., An, B1, B2, ..., Bn and B1, B2, ..., Bm respectively. The result of R/S is a relation T with
  - Schema A1, A2, ..., An attribute names in R but not in S
  - Tuples t such that, for every tuple s of S, the tuple t||s is in relation R
  - T contains the largest possible set of tuples s.t.SxT subset of R
