An Algebra is:
- Operands (Values): variables, constants, closed domain
- Operators: +, *
- Expressions: Combine operations with parenthesis or using either preceduence
- Laws: Identify semantically equivalent expressions, Commutativity, associativity

Relational Algebra:
- values: Finite relations (cardinality and arity both bounded); Attributes may or may not be typed
- Operators: Unary, "Additive" (set), "Multiplicative", []
- Expressions: same as arithmetic, but called "queries"
- Laws: allow "query rewriting", basis for query optimization, []
